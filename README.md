## Conway's Game of Life - Coffeescript

This is is my first attempt to build a coffeescript version of Conway's Game of
Life. It comes after my ruby version, so it will probably look like that one in
the end.
My goal for this funny exercise is to increase my confidence with TDD on
javascript.

usage:
```
  coffee index.coffee
```
